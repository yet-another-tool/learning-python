# emnist

## Context

I wanted to learn Python and basics of AI,  
I followed this course: https://www.udemy.com/share/105WJM3@A_hajqu6L3PVs_anmHlr5SRFacYkUBRSGlgtlbiiOjLKAAeotUdBna4OnCFfBo4=/
I do recommend it !

### Goal

Continue to improve this code to build a better and more complete knowledge with python

#### Wishlist

- Integrate Numpy (Learn numpy)
- Move to GPU (I saw `numba` that seems to depend on `numpy`)
- Add Random Seed to replay easily a seed if I mess up somewhere
- Improve logging and saving
- Add Visualization (like we saw in the course)
- Understand the math behind :|
